# Introduction

Satoshi Perps has adopted the Resilient Price Oracle protocol from Venus to secure our price feed system. This multi-source approach overcomes the limitations of single-source oracles.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Source Price Feeds
Pulls price data from several reputable sources:
- APRO
- Pyth Network
- RedStone
- Switchboard
- stork

### 2. Cross-Validation Mechanism
Utilizes an algorithm to compare prices and mitigate erroneous or stale data.

### 3. Fallback System
Automatically switches to alternative sources if a primary feed fails, ensuring continuous accuracy.

### 4. Flexible Per-Token Configuration
Allows enabling/disabling specific oracles per token for optimal pricing.

## Governance and Security

### Configurable Settings:
Governance can adjust:
- Oracle pausing/resuming
- Price feed configurations
- Fixed price settings when needed

### Robust Security Measures:
- Ensures smooth transitions during updates.
- Code has been thoroughly tested and audited.

### Specialized Handling for Correlated Tokens:
Uses smart contracts to adjust pricing for tokens with strong correlations, ensuring accuracy.

## Advantages for Satoshi Perps:
- Enhanced resilience against oracle failures or attacks.
- Improved pricing accuracy, reducing liquidation risks.
- Flexibility to adapt and integrate new price sources.
- Overall increased security and protocol stability.
