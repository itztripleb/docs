# Bitcoin-backed Perpetuals On-chain

## Comprehensive Technical Overview

Satoshi Perps is designed to bring Bitcoin-backed perpetual contracts to the Core blockchain, enhancing capital efficiency while maintaining BTC exposure. Key functionalities include:

- Enabling Bitcoin holders to earn yields on their BTC without losing directional exposure.
- Facilitating on-chain perpetual trading using Bitcoin-based assets as collateral.
- Providing simplified and scalable liquidity through Bitcoin-denominated liquidity pools.

This is accomplished via five core components:

1. Vault  
2. Routers  
3. Price Feeds  
4. $SAT Satoshi App Token  
5. SLP

Let’s delve into each component:

## Vault: The Core of Satoshi Perps

The Vault contract manages deposits, withdrawals, and trading operations. Key features include:

### Deposits
Users deposit Bitcoin-based tokens (e.g., WBTC, coreBTC) into the Vault to mint SLP-BTC tokens.

### Withdrawals
Burn SLP tokens to redeem underlying assets based on the token’s current price.

### Trading
Supports both long and short positions using Bitcoin as collateral:
- **Longing:** Deposit Bitcoin tokens and open a leveraged long position.
- **Shorting:** Deposit Bitcoin tokens and open a leveraged short position.
- **Liquidations:** Automated liquidation if collateral falls below required thresholds.

## Routers: Streamlining Transactions

Routers simplify user interactions by handling token transfers, wrapping/unwrapping native tokens, and mitigating front-running through a two-step position process.

## Price Feeds: Ensuring Accurate Pricing

The PriceFeed contract collects price data via a Resilient Oracle that compares keeper prices with a fallback mechanism, ensuring:
- Fair pricing for opening and closing positions.
- Protection against rapid price fluctuations.
- Expiry mechanisms and safeguards against manipulation.

## $SAT Satoshi Token: Governance, Staking, and Rewards

The $SAT token is used for governance, staking rewards (paid in $BTC), and protocol incentives through $rSAT.

## SLP: Correlation-based Liquidity Provision

SLP tokens represent shares in asset-specific liquidity pools. They minimize impermanent loss while earning yields from fees, trader losses, and liquidations.

## Key Differentiators

- **Bitcoin-Centric Design:** Maintains BTC collateral and yield.
- **Flexible Collateral:** Supports diverse Bitcoin-based assets.
- **Advanced Risk Management:** Dynamic liquidation, partial liquidations, and liquidation guards.
- **Innovative Borrow Rate Mechanism:** Balances positions and offers additional yield.
- **Access Control & Upgradeability:** Robust access controls and multi-sig safety mechanisms.
- **Advanced Attack Mitigations:** Front-running protection, flash loan prevention, and oracle manipulation resistance.
