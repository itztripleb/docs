# Welcome to Satoshi Perps

Satoshi Perps v1 is a fully on-chain Bitcoin-backed Perpetuals Exchange built on Core, a Bitcoin-aligned EVM L1

## The Satoshi Perps Mission

Imagine a world where Bitcoin isn't just a store of value, but a powerful engine driving a new financial ecosystem. This is the vision behind Satoshi Perps, a protocol designed to bring Bitcoin-backed perpetual trading to the Core Blockchain.

Satoshi Perps' mission is simple yet revolutionary: to empower Bitcoin holders with the tools to put their BTC to work, earning yields and participating in trading markets without ever leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem. By building on-chain perpetual contracts backed by Bitcoin, Satoshi Perps aims to increase capital efficiency while allowing users to maintain their exposure to BTC.

Let's dive into how Satoshi Perps makes this vision a reality.

## Leverage Trading 

Users can open up to 250x leveraged long or short positions on many asset classes including Cryptocurrency, Forex, and Commodities. Satoshi Perps also accepts various Bitcoin synthetic assets as collateral with a correlation based liquidity aggregation model, allowing for flexible position and risk management strategies.

## Market Making Vaults (SLP)

Users can simply deposit assets into the SLP-BTC vault to become market makers on Satoshi Perps. Satoshi Perps offers one of the highest real APR% for LPs in the market paid in $BTC. This is achieved through 3 yield sources:

- A portion of the platform revenue from open/close fees and borrow rates are allocated as rewards for liquidity providers in the form of yield paid in BTC.
- SLPs (Satoshi Liquidity Providers) accrue value from all trader losses and liquidations from acting as constant counterparties to all trades.
- Satoshi Perps also allocates a significant percentage of $rSAT emissions to the LPs as additional incentives.
