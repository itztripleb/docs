# PositionManager

The PositionManager contract extends BasePositionManager with user-facing functionality for position management. It includes role-based access control for position execution and liquidation.

## Contract Overview

The PositionManager handles:
- Direct creation, modification, and liquidation of positions
- Execution of orders from the OrderBook
- Role-based access control for different operations
- Integration with the OrderBook for limit orders

<Info>
The PositionManager provides direct position execution functionality, as opposed to the queue-based approach of the PositionRouter.

## Key Functions

### Position Management

```solidity
function increasePosition(
    address[] memory _path,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _amountIn,
    uint256 _minOut,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    uint256 _price
) external;
```

Increases a position with the specified parameters.

```solidity
function increasePositionETH(
    address[] memory _path,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _minOut,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    uint256 _price
) external payable;
```

Increases a position using ETH as the input token.

```solidity
function decreasePosition(
    address _collateralToken,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _collateralDelta,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    address _receiver,
    uint256 _price
) external;
```

Decreases a position with the specified parameters.

```solidity
function decreasePositionETH(
    address _collateralToken,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _collateralDelta,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    address payable _receiver,
    uint256 _price
) external;
```

Decreases a position and receives ETH instead of WETH.

### Liquidation

```solidity
function liquidatePosition(
    address _account,
    address _collateralToken,
    address _indexToken,
    bool _isLong,
    address _feeReceiver
) external;
```

Liquidates a position if it meets the liquidation criteria.

### Order Execution

```solidity
function executeIncreaseOrder(
    address _account,
    uint256 _orderIndex,
    address payable _feeReceiver
) external;
```

Executes an increase order from the OrderBook.

```solidity
function executeDecreaseOrder(
    address _account,
    uint256 _orderIndex,
    address payable _feeReceiver
) external;
```

Executes a decrease order from the OrderBook.

## Access Control

The PositionManager implements several access control mechanisms:

```solidity
function setOrderKeeper(address _account, bool _isActive) external;
```

Sets or removes an order keeper who can execute orders.

```solidity
function setLiquidator(address _account, bool _isActive) external;
```

Sets or removes a liquidator who can liquidate positions.

```solidity
function setPartner(address _account, bool _isActive) external;
```

Sets or removes a partner who can place orders for their users.

```solidity
function setInLegacyMode(bool _inLegacyMode) external;
```

Sets the contract to legacy mode, which affects access control.

## Validation

```solidity
function setShouldValidateIncreaseOrder(bool _shouldValidateIncreaseOrder) external;
```

Sets whether increase orders should be validated before execution.

```solidity
function shouldValidateIncreaseOrder() external view returns (bool);
```

Returns whether increase orders should be validated.

## Integration with OrderBook

The PositionManager is tightly integrated with the OrderBook contract:

```solidity
function setOrderBook(address _orderBook) external;
```

Sets the OrderBook contract address.

```solidity
function orderBook() external view returns (address);
```

Returns the OrderBook contract address.

## Security Considerations

The PositionManager implements several security features:
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different roles for order execution and liquidation
- **Price Validation**: Ensures that positions are executed at reasonable prices
- **Integration Validation**: Validates interaction with other contracts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios

<Warning>
Only approved liquidators can liquidate positions when in private liquidation mode.
</Warning>

## Example Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Increasing a Position">
    A trader wants to open a 5x long ETH position with 1 ETH as collateral.
    
    ```javascript
    // Price to use for execution
    const ethPrice = ethers.utils.parseUnits("2000", 30);
    
    // Increase position parameters
    await positionManager.increasePositionETH(
      [wethAddress], // Path (no token swap)
      wethAddress, // Index token (ETH)
      0, // Min output (no swap)
      ethers.utils.parseUnits("5", 30), // Size delta (5x leverage)
      true, // Is long
      ethPrice, // Price to use
      { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1") } // 1 ETH as collateral
    );
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decreasing a Position">
    Later, the trader wants to close half of the position.
    
    ```javascript
    // Price to use for execution
    const ethPrice = ethers.utils.parseUnits("2100", 30);
    
    // Decrease position parameters
    await positionManager.decreasePositionETH(
      wethAddress, // Collateral token
      wethAddress, // Index token
      ethers.utils.parseEther("0.5"), // Withdraw half of the collateral
      ethers.utils.parseUnits("2.5", 30), // Size delta (half position size)
      true, // Is long
      userAddress, // Receiver
      ethPrice // Price to use
    );
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Executing an Order">
    An order keeper notices a pending increase order that meets its execution conditions.
    
    ```javascript
    // Order keeper executes the order
    await positionManager.executeIncreaseOrder(
      userAddress, // Account that created the order
      0, // Order index
      keeperAddress // Fee receiver
    );
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Legacy Mode

The PositionManager includes a legacy mode feature:

```solidity
function setInLegacyMode(bool _inLegacyMode) external;
```

In legacy mode, certain access control restrictions are relaxed, making the PositionManager backward compatible with earlier versions. This feature is typically used during protocol upgrades when necessary to maintain compatibility.
