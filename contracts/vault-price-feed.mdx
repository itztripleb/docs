# VaultPriceFeed

The VaultPriceFeed contract serves as the oracle system for the Satoshi Perps protocol, providing token prices for various operations such as position sizing, liquidation checks, and swap calculations.

## Contract Overview

The VaultPriceFeed handles:
- Fetching token prices from multiple oracle sources
- Validating and adjusting price data
- Providing maximum and minimum prices with configurable spread
- Supporting both chainlink and custom price feeds

<Info>
The VaultPriceFeed is a crucial component for the protocol as accurate price data is essential for fair position sizing, liquidations, and swaps.

## Key Functions

### Price Retrieval

```solidity
function getPrice(
    address _token,
    bool _maximise,
    bool _includeAmmPrice,
    bool _useSwapPricing
) external view returns (uint256);
```

Returns the price of a token with various options for price calculation.

```solidity
function getPrimaryPrice(address _token, bool _maximise) public view returns (uint256);
```

Returns the primary price from the oracle without any adjustments.

### Price Feed Configuration

```solidity
function setAdjustment(
    address _token,
    bool _isAdditive,
    uint256 _adjustmentBps
) external;
```

Sets a price adjustment for a token, either as an additive or multiplicative factor.

```solidity
function setSpreadBasisPoints(address _token, uint256 _spreadBasisPoints) external;
```

Sets the spread in basis points between the maximum and minimum price for a token.

```solidity
function setChainlinkPriceFeed(
    address _token,
    address _priceFeed
) external;
```

Sets the Chainlink price feed address for a token.

## Oracle Sources

The VaultPriceFeed can use multiple sources for price data:

1. **Chainlink Oracle**: The primary source for price data, known for its reliability and decentralization
2. **Secondary Price Feeds**: Can be configured as backup or complementary price sources
3. **AMM-based Pricing**: Can use prices derived from AMM pools (though typically less reliable)

<Warning>
The VaultPriceFeed prioritizes Chainlink oracles for price data. Secondary sources are only used when explicitly configured or when primary sources are unavailable.
</Warning>

## Price Adjustments

The contract allows for price adjustments to handle various scenarios:

```solidity
function getAdjustedPrice(
    address _token,
    uint256 _price,
    bool _maximise
) public view returns (uint256);
```

Applies configured adjustments to a token's price:
- If `_isAdditive` is true, adds or subtracts `_adjustmentBps` basis points
- If `_isAdditive` is false, multiplies by `(10000 +/- _adjustmentBps) / 10000`
- The sign depends on `_maximise` (plus for max price, minus for min price)

## Spread Mechanism

The price feed implements a spread mechanism that provides slightly different prices depending on the operation:

- For buy operations, the `_maximise` parameter is set to `true`, returning a higher price
- For sell operations, the `_maximise` parameter is set to `false`, returning a lower price

This spread helps protect the protocol from sandwich attacks and provides a buffer for price movements.

## Security Considerations

The VaultPriceFeed implements several security features:
- **Multiple Price Sources**: Can fall back to secondary sources if primary fails
- **Price Validation**: Checks that prices are within reasonable ranges
- **Admin Controls**: Only authorized addresses can update price feed configurations
- **Spread Mechanism**: Creates a buffer against price manipulation

<Note>
The security of the price feed is critical to the overall security of the protocol. Any compromise in price data could potentially affect all protocol operations.
</Note>

## Integration with Vault

The Vault contract uses the VaultPriceFeed for various operations:

1. **Position Sizing**: Determines USD value of collateral and position sizes
2. **Liquidation Checks**: Determines if positions are undercollateralized
3. **Swap Calculations**: Determines exchange rates for token swaps
4. **PnL Calculations**: Determines profit and loss for positions

## Example Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Getting Token Price">
    The Vault needs to get the price of ETH to calculate position value.
    
    ```javascript
    // In the Vault contract
    function getTokenPrice(address token, bool maximize) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return vaultPriceFeed.getPrice(
            token,
            maximize,
            false, // Don't include AMM price
            false  // Don't use swap pricing
        );
    }
    
    // Getting ETH price for a long position
    uint256 ethPrice = getTokenPrice(wethAddress, true);
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuring Price Feed">
    An admin wants to set up a new token's price feed.
    
    ```javascript
    // Set Chainlink price feed for TOKEN
    await vaultPriceFeed.setChainlinkPriceFeed(
      tokenAddress,
      chainlinkPriceFeedAddress
    );
    
    // Set a spread of 0.2% (20 basis points)
    await vaultPriceFeed.setSpreadBasisPoints(
      tokenAddress,
      20
    );
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Applying Price Adjustment">
    During extreme market conditions, an admin applies a buffer to prices.
    
    ```javascript
    // Add a 1% buffer to prices (100 basis points)
    await vaultPriceFeed.setAdjustment(
      tokenAddress,
      true, // Additive adjustment
      100   // 100 basis points (1%)
    );
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Price Feed Failure Handling

The VaultPriceFeed includes fallback mechanisms for handling price feed failures:

1. If a Chainlink price feed fails, the contract can fall back to secondary price sources
2. If all price feeds fail, the governance can update the price feeds or apply temporary adjustments
3. In extreme cases, the protocol has circuit breakers to pause operations if price data is unavailable or unreliable

<Warning>
It is critical to monitor the health of price feeds, as inaccurate pricing can lead to unfair liquidations or allow exploitative trades.
