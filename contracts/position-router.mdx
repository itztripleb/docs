# PositionRouter

The PositionRouter is a crucial component of the Satoshi Perps protocol that implements a gas-efficient queue-based system for position execution. It allows users to submit position requests that are executed in batches by keepers, significantly reducing gas costs for users.

<Note>
For visual flowcharts of the position creation and execution process, see the [Protocol Flow Charts](/contracts/flow-charts) page.
</Note>

## Contract Overview

The PositionRouter handles:
- Creating requests to increase or decrease positions
- Queueing position requests for batch execution
- Executing position requests in an efficient manner
- Managing execution fees for position requests
- Providing callbacks to notify external contracts when positions are executed

<Note>
The PositionRouter is designed to handle high-volume trading with minimal gas costs per trade.

## Key Functions

### Position Creation

```solidity
function createIncreasePosition(
    address[] memory _path,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _amountIn,
    uint256 _minOut,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    uint256 _acceptablePrice,
    uint256 _executionFee,
    bytes32 _referralCode,
    address _callbackTarget
) external payable returns (bytes32);
```

Creates a request to increase a position. Returns a unique request key.

```solidity
function createIncreasePositionETH(
    address[] memory _path,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _minOut,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    uint256 _acceptablePrice,
    uint256 _executionFee,
    bytes32 _referralCode,
    address _callbackTarget
) external payable returns (bytes32);
```

Creates a request to increase a position using ETH as the input token.

### Position Decrease

```solidity
function createDecreasePosition(
    address[] memory _path,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _collateralDelta,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    address _receiver,
    uint256 _acceptablePrice,
    uint256 _minOut,
    uint256 _executionFee,
    bool _withdrawETH,
    address _callbackTarget
) external payable returns (bytes32);
```

Creates a request to decrease a position.

### Position Execution

```solidity
function executeIncreasePosition(bytes32 _key, address _executionFeeReceiver) external returns (bool);
```

Executes a queued increase position request. Returns a boolean indicating execution success.

```solidity
function executeDecreasePosition(bytes32 _key, address _executionFeeReceiver) external returns (bool);
```

Executes a queued decrease position request. Returns a boolean indicating execution success.

### Batch Execution

```solidity
function executeIncreasePositions(uint256 _endIndex, address payable _executionFeeReceiver) external;
```

Executes multiple increase position requests in a single transaction.

```solidity
function executeDecreasePositions(uint256 _endIndex, address payable _executionFeeReceiver) external;
```

Executes multiple decrease position requests in a single transaction.

## Request Queue Mechanics

The PositionRouter maintains two separate queues:
1. **Increase Position Queue**: For requests to open or add to positions
2. **Decrease Position Queue**: For requests to reduce or close positions

Each request is stored with:
- A unique request key
- The parameters needed for execution
- A timestamp indicating when the request was created
- Whether the request has been executed

<Warning>
Requests have a limited lifespan defined by the `maxTimeDelay` parameter. If not executed within this time window, they can be cancelled by the requester.
</Warning>

## Callback System

The PositionRouter implements a callback mechanism to notify external contracts when positions are executed:

```solidity
function gmxPositionCallback(bytes32 positionKey, bool isExecuted, bool isIncrease) external;
```

When a position is executed, if a callback target was specified in the request, this function is called on the target contract to notify it of the execution result. The callback target must implement the IPositionRouterCallbackReceiver interface.

## Execution Fee Mechanism

To incentivize keepers to execute position requests, the PositionRouter requires an execution fee for each request:

- Users include an execution fee when creating a position request
- The fee is refunded if the request fails to execute
- When a request is executed successfully, the fee is sent to the keeper

<Info>
The minimum execution fee is defined by the `minExecutionFee` parameter and can be adjusted by the contract admin.
</Info>

## Integration with Vault

The PositionRouter interacts with the Vault contract to execute positions:

1. When an increase position request is executed, the PositionRouter:
   - Transfers tokens from the user (if not already done)
   - Calls Vault's increasePosition function
   
2. When a decrease position request is executed, the PositionRouter:
   - Calls Vault's decreasePosition function
   - Handles token transfers back to the user

## Callback Gas Limits

The PositionRouter implements configurable gas limits for position execution callbacks:

```solidity
uint256 public callbackGasLimit;
mapping (address => uint256) public customCallbackGasLimits;
```

- `callbackGasLimit`: Default gas limit for all callbacks
- `customCallbackGasLimits`: Custom gas limits for specific callback targets

Admins can set these limits using:
```solidity
function setCallbackGasLimit(uint256 _callbackGasLimit) external;
function setCustomCallbackGasLimit(address _target, uint256 _gasLimit) external;
```

## Position Cancellation

Users can cancel their pending position requests if they haven't been executed within the allowed time window:

```solidity
function cancelIncreasePosition(bytes32 _key, address _executionFeeReceiver) external;
function cancelDecreasePosition(bytes32 _key, address _executionFeeReceiver) external;
```

These functions validate that:
- The request exists
- The caller is the request creator
- The request has not been executed
- The execution timeframe has expired

## Position Keepers

The PositionRouter uses a keeper system to manage who can execute position requests:

```solidity
mapping (address => bool) public isPositionKeeper;
```

Only approved position keepers can execute position requests, controlled by:
```solidity
function setPositionKeeper(address _account, bool _isActive) external;
```

## Security Considerations

The PositionRouter implements several security features:
- **Frontrunning Protection**: Price bounds protect users from price manipulation
- **Slippage Protection**: Minimum output amounts ensure fair execution
- **Delay Parameters**: Configurable minimum and maximum delay between request and execution
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for execution and configuration
- **Circuit Breakers**: The contract can be paused in emergency situations
- **Gas Limit Controls**: Prevents callback functions from using excessive gas

## Example Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit an Increase Position Request">
    A trader wants to open a 5x long ETH position with 1 ETH as collateral.
    
    ```javascript
    const path = [wethAddress]; // No token conversion needed
    const indexToken = wethAddress; // Long ETH
    const amountIn = ethers.utils.parseEther("1"); // 1 ETH
    const minOut = 0; // No swap, so minOut is 0
    const sizeDelta = ethers.utils.parseUnits("5", 30); // 5x leverage
    const isLong = true;
    const acceptablePrice = ethers.utils.parseUnits("2000", 30); // Max acceptable ETH price
    const executionFee = ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01"); // Execution fee
    const referralCode = ethers.utils.formatBytes32String(""); // No referral
    const callbackTarget = ethers.constants.AddressZero; // No callback
    
    const requestKey = await positionRouter.createIncreasePositionETH(
      path,
      indexToken,
      minOut,
      sizeDelta,
      isLong,
      acceptablePrice,
      executionFee,
      referralCode,
      callbackTarget,
      { value: amountIn.add(executionFee) }
    );
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keeper Executes the Request">
    A keeper monitors the pending requests and executes them.
    
    ```javascript
    // Keeper executes the position
    await positionRouter.executeIncreasePosition(
      requestKey, 
      keeperAddress
    );
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit a Decrease Position Request">
    Later, the trader wants to close half of their position.
    
    ```javascript
    const path = [wethAddress]; // No token conversion
    const indexToken = wethAddress;
    const collateralDelta = 0; // Don't withdraw collateral
    const sizeDelta = ethers.utils.parseUnits("2.5", 30); // Close half the position
    const isLong = true;
    const receiver = traderAddress;
    const acceptablePrice = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1900", 30); // Min acceptable ETH price
    const minOut = 0; // No minimum output for collateral
    const executionFee = ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01");
    const withdrawETH = true; // Receive ETH instead of WETH
    const callbackTarget = ethers.constants.AddressZero;
    
    const requestKey = await positionRouter.createDecreasePosition(
      path,
      indexToken,
      collateralDelta,
      sizeDelta,
      isLong,
      receiver,
      acceptablePrice,
      minOut,
      executionFee,
      withdrawETH,
      callbackTarget,
      { value: executionFee }
    );
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Batch Execution Efficiency

One of the PositionRouter's key features is batch execution, which allows keepers to execute multiple position requests in a single transaction:

```solidity
// Execute up to 10 increase positions in one transaction
await positionRouter.executeIncreasePositions(10, keeperAddress);

// Execute up to 10 decrease positions in one transaction
await positionRouter.executeDecreasePositions(10, keeperAddress);
```

This significantly reduces the average gas cost per position by amortizing fixed gas costs across multiple executions.
