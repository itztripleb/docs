# PositionUtils

The PositionUtils is a library contract that provides utility functions for position management across the Satoshi Perps protocol. It encapsulates common position-related logic for reuse across different contracts.

## Contract Overview

The PositionUtils handles:
- Utility functions for fee calculations
- Helper functions for position operations
- Standardized implementations of common position logic

<Info>
As a library, PositionUtils does not store state and is designed to be used by other contracts.

## Key Functions

### Fee Utilities

```solidity
function shouldDeductFee(
    address _account,
    address _router,
    address[] memory _path,
    uint256 _amountIn,
    address _indexToken,
    bool _isLong
) external view returns (bool);
```

Determines whether a deposit fee should be charged to prevent zero-fee swaps.

### Position Operations

```solidity
function increasePosition(
    address _account,
    address _collateralToken,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    uint256 _price
) external;
```

Standard implementation for increasing a position with validation.

## Usage in Other Contracts

The PositionUtils library is utilized by various contracts in the Satoshi Perps protocol:

1. **BasePositionManager**: Uses utility functions for position operations
2. **PositionManager**: Inherits position utility functions through BasePositionManager
3. **PositionRouter**: Uses fee utility functions to determine fee application

## Implementation Details

### Fee Deduction Logic

The `shouldDeductFee` function implements the following logic:
- If the path length is 1 (no swap), check if amountIn is greater than 0
- If it's a long position with collateral token same as index token, no fee
- For all other cases, apply the fee

This logic helps prevent users from avoiding fees through complex transaction paths.

## Integration Example

Here's how the PositionUtils library is typically used in other contracts:

```solidity
// In a position management contract
function increasePosition(/* parameters */) external {
    bool shouldChargeFee = PositionUtils.shouldDeductFee(
        msg.sender,
        router,
        path,
        amountIn,
        indexToken,
        isLong
    );
    
    if (shouldChargeFee) {
        // Apply fee logic
    }
    
    // Proceed with position increase
}
```

## Benefits of Library Approach

Using a library for position utilities offers several advantages:
- **Code Reusability**: Common logic is defined once and reused across contracts
- **Gas Efficiency**: Library code is deployed once and shared by all contracts
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform behavior across different contract implementations
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the utility functions need to be made in only one place

<Note>
Library contracts like PositionUtils help maintain consistent behavior across the protocol and make the codebase more maintainable.
