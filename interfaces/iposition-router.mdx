# IPositionRouter Interface

The `IPositionRouter` interface defines the functions available in the PositionRouter contract, which manages the queuing and execution of position requests in the Satoshi Perps protocol.

## Position Creation

### Increase Positions

```solidity
function createIncreasePosition(
    address[] memory _path,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _amountIn,
    uint256 _minOut,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    uint256 _acceptablePrice,
    uint256 _executionFee,
    bytes32 _referralCode,
    address _callbackTarget
) external payable returns (bytes32);
```
Creates a request to increase a position.

```solidity
function createIncreasePositionETH(
    address[] memory _path,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _minOut,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    uint256 _acceptablePrice,
    uint256 _executionFee,
    bytes32 _referralCode,
    address _callbackTarget
) external payable returns (bytes32);
```
Creates a request to increase a position using ETH as the input token.

### Decrease Positions

```solidity
function createDecreasePosition(
    address[] memory _path,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _collateralDelta,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    address _receiver,
    uint256 _acceptablePrice,
    uint256 _minOut,
    uint256 _executionFee,
    bool _withdrawETH,
    address _callbackTarget
) external payable returns (bytes32);
```
Creates a request to decrease a position.

## Position Execution

```solidity
function executeIncreasePosition(bytes32 _key, address _executionFeeReceiver) external;
```
Executes a queued increase position request.

```solidity
function executeDecreasePosition(bytes32 _key, address _executionFeeReceiver) external;
```
Executes a queued decrease position request.

```solidity
function executeIncreasePositions(uint256 _endIndex, address payable _executionFeeReceiver) external;
```
Executes multiple increase position requests in a single transaction.

```solidity
function executeDecreasePositions(uint256 _endIndex, address payable _executionFeeReceiver) external;
```
Executes multiple decrease position requests in a single transaction.

## Request Cancellation

```solidity
function cancelIncreasePosition(bytes32 _key, address payable _executionFeeReceiver) external;
```
Cancels a pending increase position request.

```solidity
function cancelDecreasePosition(bytes32 _key, address payable _executionFeeReceiver) external;
```
Cancels a pending decrease position request.

## Request Query

```solidity
function getRequestQueueLengths() external view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256);
```
Returns the lengths of the request queues (increase queue, decrease queue, already processed increase requests, already processed decrease requests).

```solidity
function getIncreasePositionRequestPath(bytes32 _key) external view returns (address[] memory);
```
Returns the token path for an increase position request.

```solidity
function getDecreasePositionRequestPath(bytes32 _key) external view returns (address[] memory);
```
Returns the token path for a decrease position request.

## Configuration

```solidity
function setPositionKeeper(address _account, bool _isActive) external;
```
Sets or removes a position keeper who can execute position requests.

```solidity
function setMinExecutionFee(uint256 _minExecutionFee) external;
```
Sets the minimum execution fee required for position requests.

```solidity
function setIsLeverageEnabled(bool _isLeverageEnabled) external;
```
Sets whether leverage trading is enabled.

```solidity
function setDelayValues(uint256 _minBlockDelayKeeper, uint256 _minTimeDelayPublic, uint256 _maxTimeDelay) external;
```
Sets the delay values for position execution.

```solidity
function setRequestKeysStartValues(uint256 _increasePositionRequestKeysStart, uint256 _decreasePositionRequestKeysStart) external;
```
Sets the starting values for request keys.

## Callback System

```solidity
function callbackFunction(bytes32 positionKey, bool isExecuted, bool isIncrease) external;
```
Callback function called after a position is executed or fails to execute.

## State Access

```solidity
function increasePositionRequests(bytes32 _key) external view returns (
    address account,
    address[] memory path,
    address indexToken,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 minOut,
    uint256 sizeDelta,
    bool isLong,
    uint256 acceptablePrice,
    uint256 executionFee,
    uint256 blockNumber,
    uint256 blockTime,
    bool isETH,
    bytes32 callbackContract
);
```
Returns details about an increase position request.

```solidity
function decreasePositionRequests(bytes32 _key) external view returns (
    address account,
    address[] memory path,
    address indexToken,
    uint256 collateralDelta,
    uint256 sizeDelta,
    bool isLong,
    address receiver,
    uint256 acceptablePrice,
    uint256 minOut,
    uint256 executionFee,
    uint256 blockNumber,
    uint256 blockTime,
    bool isETH,
    bytes32 callbackContract
);
```
Returns details about a decrease position request.

## Usage Notes

- Position requests are added to a queue and executed by keepers or the public after a delay.
- Each request requires an execution fee to incentivize keepers to execute it.
- The PositionRouter uses a callback system to notify external contracts when positions are executed.
- Requests have a maximum execution time window, after which they can be cancelled.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure acceptable price parameters are set appropriately to avoid unexpected execution at unfavorable prices
- The execution fee should be sufficient to cover gas costs, otherwise requests may not be executed
- Consider the delay between request creation and execution when setting acceptable prices
