# IBasePositionManager Interface

The `IBasePositionManager` interface defines the functions available in the BasePositionManager contract, which provides core position management functionality for the Satoshi Perps protocol.

## Position Management

```solidity
function increasePosition(
    address[] memory _path,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _amountIn,
    uint256 _minOut,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    uint256 _price
) external;
```
Increases a position with the specified parameters.

```solidity
function decreasePosition(
    address _collateralToken,
    address _indexToken,
    uint256 _collateralDelta,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    bool _isLong,
    address _receiver,
    uint256 _price
) external;
```
Decreases a position with the specified parameters.

## Global Size Limits

```solidity
function setMaxGlobalSizes(
    address[] memory _tokens,
    uint256[] memory _longSizes,
    uint256[] memory _shortSizes
) external;
```
Sets the maximum global long and short sizes for a list of tokens.

```solidity
function maxGlobalLongSizes(address _token) external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the maximum global long size for a token.

```solidity
function maxGlobalShortSizes(address _token) external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the maximum global short size for a token.

## Fee Configuration

```solidity
function setDepositFee(uint256 _depositFee) external;
```
Sets the deposit fee basis points.

```solidity
function depositFee() external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the current deposit fee basis points.

## Token Management

```solidity
function transferIn(address _token) external returns (uint256);
```
Transfers tokens from the sender to the contract.

```solidity
function transferOut(
    address _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver
) external;
```
Transfers tokens from the contract to a receiver.

```solidity
function swap(
    address[] memory _path,
    uint256 _amountIn,
    uint256 _minOut,
    address _receiver
) external returns (uint256);
```
Executes a token swap through the Router.

## Fee Collection

```solidity
function feeReserves(address _token) external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the amount of fees collected for a token.

```solidity
function collectFees(
    address _token,
    address _receiver
) external returns (uint256);
```
Collects accumulated fees for a token and sends them to the specified receiver.

## Contract References

```solidity
function vault() external view returns (address);
```
Returns the address of the Vault contract.

```solidity
function router() external view returns (address);
```
Returns the address of the Router contract.

```solidity
function shortsTracker() external view returns (address);
```
Returns the address of the ShortsTracker contract.

```solidity
function weth() external view returns (address);
```
Returns the address of the WETH token.

## ETH Handling

```solidity
function receiveETH() external payable;
```
Receives ETH sent to the contract.

## Usage Notes

- The BasePositionManager is an abstract contract designed to be inherited by concrete implementations like PositionManager.
- It provides core functionality for position management but lacks user-facing methods.
- The contract implements safety checks such as global position size limits.
- Fee collection is handled automatically when positions are adjusted.

## Security Considerations

- Functions are protected by various access controls in implementing contracts
- Global size limits help prevent excessive risk concentration in specific tokens
- Deposit fees may be charged to prevent abuse of zero-fee swaps
