# ISlpManager Interface

The `ISlpManager` interface defines the functions available in the SlpManager contract, which manages the Staked Liquidity Provider (SLP) token system for the Satoshi Perps protocol.

## Liquidity Management

```solidity
function addLiquidity(
    address _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _minSlp,
    uint256 _minToken
) external returns (uint256);
```
Adds liquidity to the protocol and mints SLP tokens.

```solidity
function removeLiquidity(
    address _tokenOut,
    uint256 _slpAmount,
    uint256 _minOut,
    address _receiver
) external returns (uint256);
```
Burns SLP tokens and returns the underlying assets.

## AUM and Price Calculation

```solidity
function getAum(bool _maximise) external view returns (uint256);
```
Calculates the total Assets Under Management (AUM) of the protocol.

```solidity
function getAumInToken(bool _maximise) external view returns (uint256);
```
Calculates the AUM in terms of the pool token.

```solidity
function getSlpPrice(bool _maximise) external view returns (uint256);
```
Calculates the price of SLP tokens based on the AUM and total supply.

## Fee and AUM Management

```solidity
function setCooldownDuration(uint256 _cooldownDuration) external;
```
Sets the cooldown duration for SLP token redemptions.

```solidity
function setAumAdjustment(uint256 _aumAddition, uint256 _aumDeduction) external;
```
Sets adjustments to the AUM calculation for accurate pricing.

## State Access

```solidity
function cooldownDuration() external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the cooldown duration for SLP token redemptions.

```solidity
function aumAddition() external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the amount added to the AUM calculation.

```solidity
function aumDeduction() external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the amount deducted from the AUM calculation.

```solidity
function slp() external view returns (address);
```
Returns the address of the SLP token.

```solidity
function vault() external view returns (address);
```
Returns the address of the Vault contract.

## Usage Notes

- The SlpManager acts as the minting and burning authority for SLP tokens.
- Liquidity providers receive SLP tokens representing their share of the pool.
- SLP tokens accrue value as the protocol earns fees.
- Withdrawals are subject to a cooldown period to prevent flash loan attacks.
- The AUM calculation determines the value backing SLP tokens, including assets in the Vault and any adjustments.

## Security Considerations

- The cooldown period protects the protocol from potential flash loan exploits.
- AUM adjustments should be used carefully as they directly affect the price of SLP tokens.
- Minimum output values protect users from slippage during liquidity operations.
