# IVaultUtils Interface

The `IVaultUtils` interface defines the functions available in the VaultUtils contract, which provides utility functions for the Vault including fee calculations, position validation, and funding rate updates.

## Position Validation

```solidity
function validateLiquidation(
    address _account,
    address _collateralToken,
    address _indexToken,
    bool _isLong,
    bool _raise
) external view returns (uint256, uint256);
```
Validates whether a position can be liquidated and returns liquidation information.

## Fee Calculations

```solidity
function getPositionFee(
    address _account,
    address _collateralToken,
    address _indexToken,
    bool _isLong,
    uint256 _sizeDelta
) external view returns (uint256);
```
Calculates the fee for increasing or decreasing a position.

```solidity
function getFundingFee(
    address _account,
    address _collateralToken,
    address _indexToken,
    bool _isLong,
    uint256 _size,
    uint256 _entryFundingRate
) external view returns (uint256);
```
Calculates the funding fee for a position based on its size and entry funding rate.

```solidity
function getFeeBasisPoints(
    address _token,
    uint256 _usdgDelta,
    uint256 _feeBasisPoints,
    uint256 _taxBasisPoints,
    bool _increment
) external view returns (uint256);
```
Calculates dynamic fee basis points based on token pool utilization.

## Configuration

```solidity
function updateCumulativeFundingRate(
    address _collateralToken,
    address _indexToken
) external returns (bool);
```
Updates the cumulative funding rate for a token pair.

```solidity
function setVault(address _vault) external;
```
Sets the address of the Vault contract.

## Usage Notes

- The VaultUtils contract is a companion to the main Vault, handling complex calculations and validations.
- It helps keep the Vault code cleaner and more modular.
- The contract is upgradeable separately from the main Vault, allowing improvements to fee calculations without changing the core Vault.
- All interactions with VaultUtils typically flow through the Vault contract rather than being called directly by users.

## Security Considerations

- VaultUtils has access to the Vault's state, so its security is critical.
- The fee calculations directly affect protocol economics and user experience.
- Liquidation validation is a critical security component that protects the protocol from undercollateralized positions.
