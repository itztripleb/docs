# IVaultPriceFeed Interface

The `IVaultPriceFeed` interface defines the functions available in the VaultPriceFeed contract, which serves as the price oracle system for the Satoshi Perps protocol.

## Price Retrieval

```solidity
function getPrice(
    address _token,
    bool _maximise,
    bool _includeAmmPrice,
    bool _useSwapPricing
) external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the price of a token with various options for price calculation.

```solidity
function getPrimaryPrice(address _token, bool _maximise) external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the primary price from the oracle without any adjustments.

## Price Feed Configuration

```solidity
function setAdjustment(
    address _token,
    bool _isAdditive,
    uint256 _adjustmentBps
) external;
```
Sets a price adjustment for a token, either as an additive or multiplicative factor.

```solidity
function setSpreadBasisPoints(address _token, uint256 _spreadBasisPoints) external;
```
Sets the spread in basis points between the maximum and minimum price for a token.

```solidity
function setChainlinkPriceFeed(
    address _token,
    address _priceFeed
) external;
```
Sets the Chainlink price feed address for a token.

```solidity
function setSecondaryPriceFeed(address _secondaryPriceFeed) external;
```
Sets the address of the secondary price feed.

## Price Adjustment Access

```solidity
function adjustmentBasisPoints(address _token) external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the adjustment basis points for a token.

```solidity
function isAdjustmentAdditive(address _token) external view returns (bool);
```
Returns whether the adjustment for a token is additive or multiplicative.

```solidity
function spreadBasisPoints(address _token) external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the spread basis points for a token.

## Price Feed Access

```solidity
function chainlinkPriceFeed(address _token) external view returns (address);
```
Returns the Chainlink price feed address for a token.

```solidity
function secondaryPriceFeed() external view returns (address);
```
Returns the address of the secondary price feed.

## Price Calculation

```solidity
function getAdjustedPrice(
    address _token,
    uint256 _price,
    bool _maximise
) external view returns (uint256);
```
Applies configured adjustments to a token's price.

## Usage Notes

- The VaultPriceFeed serves as the central price oracle for the Satoshi Perps protocol.
- It prioritizes Chainlink oracles but can fall back to secondary sources.
- Price adjustments and spreads can be configured per token.
- The `_maximise` parameter determines whether to return the maximum or minimum price based on the spread.

## Security Considerations

- Price data is critical for the protocol's security, as it affects position sizing, liquidations, and swaps.
- Chainlink oracles are preferred for their reliability and decentralization.
- Adjustments should be used carefully as they directly affect pricing throughout the protocol.
