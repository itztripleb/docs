# IShortsTracker Interface

The `IShortsTracker` interface defines the functions available in the ShortsTracker contract, which tracks global short positions across the Satoshi Perps protocol.

## Position Tracking

```solidity
function updateGlobalShortData(
    address _token,
    uint256 _sizeDelta,
    uint256 _markPrice,
    bool _isIncrease
) external returns (uint256);
```
Updates the global short data when a position is increased or decreased.

```solidity
function getGlobalShortDelta(
    address _token
) external view returns (bool, uint256);
```
Calculates the global profit or loss for all short positions of a token.

## State Access

```solidity
function globalShortSizes(address _token) external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the total size of all short positions for a token.

```solidity
function globalShortAveragePrices(address _token) external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the average entry price of all short positions for a token.

```solidity
function isGlobalShortDataReady() external view returns (bool);
```
Returns whether the global short data is ready for use.

## Administration

```solidity
function setIsGlobalShortDataReady(bool _value) external;
```
Sets whether the global short data is ready for use.

```solidity
function setHandler(address _handler, bool _isActive) external;
```
Sets or removes a handler that can update global short data.

```solidity
function setInitData(
    address[] memory _tokens,
    uint256[] memory _averagePrices
) external;
```
Initializes global short data during contract deployment or migration.

## Usage Notes

- The ShortsTracker complements the Vault's native tracking of long positions.
- It provides specialized tracking for short positions across the protocol.
- Only authorized handlers (like PositionManager and BasePositionManager) can update the global short data.
- The global short data is essential for funding rate calculations and protocol monitoring.

## Security Considerations

- Access to update functions is restricted to prevent manipulation of short position data.
- The readiness flag ensures that data isn't used before it's properly initialized.
- Accurate short position tracking is critical for proper funding rate calculations.
